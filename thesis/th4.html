        <h1>Th4: The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem, Proof, Simulations</h1>
        
            The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem is a fundamental result in probability theory that describes the convergence of the empirical distribution function to the true distribution function. <br>
            It is named after Valery Ivanovich Glivenko and Francesco Paolo Cantelli ². <br>
            The theorem states that the empirical distribution function converges uniformly almost surely to the theoretical distribution for a random variable X ∈ R ¹. <br>
            Formally, if \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n\) are independent and identically distributed random variables with cumulative distribution function (CDF) \(F(x)\), and \(F_n(x)\) is the empirical distribution function based on the sample, then the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem asserts that: <br>
                <div class="formula-box">
                    \[ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_n(x) - F(x)| \rightarrow 0 \text{ almost surely as } n \rightarrow \infty. \]
                </div>
            <br>
            This convergence is uniform, meaning that the maximum difference between the empirical and true distribution functions tends to zero almost surely. <br>
            
            So, the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem is crucial because it affirms that through sampling, we can effectively capture the characteristics dictated by the distribution function \( F \). As the sample size grows, the empirical distribution function converges uniformly to the true distribution function, <br>
            indicating that the probabilities inferred from samples become more accurate with increased data availability. <br>
            Consequently, studying distributions through samples is a valid and reliable approach for learning and making inferences about the underlying distribution. <br>
            
            In other words, the difference between the empirical distribution function and the true distribution function approaches zero as the sample size increases ². <br>
            <br>
            <h3><strong><u>Proof</u>:</strong></h3> 
            A constructive proof of the theorem is provided in ³. <br>
            The proof is based on the concept of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which measures the distance between the empirical distribution function and the true distribution function ¹. <br><br>
            The proof can be broken down into several steps. <br>
            First, we can apply the strong law of large numbers to the sequence I{Xi ≤ x}, i = 1, . . . n to assert that Fn(x) → F (x) a.s. <br>
            In this sense, Fn(x) ˆ is a reasonable estimate of F (x) for a given x ∈ R. But is Fn(x) a reasonable estimate of the F (x) when both are viewed as functions of x? The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem provides an answer to this question. <br>
            It asserts that the empirical distribution function converges uniformly almost surely to the theoretical distribution for a random variable X ∈ R ¹. In other words, <br>
            the difference between the empirical distribution function and the true distribution function approaches zero as the sample size increases ². <br>
            <br>
            <h3><strong><u>Simulations</u>:</strong></h3>
            Simulations can be used to illustrate the theorem. <br>
            For example, consider a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with a uniform distribution on the interval [0,1]. <br>
            The empirical distribution function can be computed for a sample of size n, and the difference between the empirical distribution function and the true distribution function can be plotted. <br>
            As the sample size increases, the difference between the two functions approaches zero, which is consistent with the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem ².<br><br>
