        <h1>Th3: The Gaussian Distribution Meaning, Derivations, Simulations</h1>
        <h4>
            The Gaussian distribution, also known as the **normal distribution**, is a probability distribution that is widely used for modeling continuous random variables ¹³. <br>
            It is a bell-shaped curve that is dependent on the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ) ¹. The probability density function of the univariate Gaussian distribution is given by: <br>
            <div class="formula-box">
                $$f(x, \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
            </div>
            where: <br>
            &nbsp    - f(x) is the probability density of obtaining the value xx. <br>
            &nbsp    - μ is the mean of the distribution. <br>
            &nbsp    - σ is the standard deviation of the distribution. <br>
            &nbsp    - π is the value of pi (approximately 3.14159). <br>
            The peak of the graph is always located at the mean and the area under the curve is always exactly equal to 1 ¹. 68% of all the values lie within one standard deviation of the mean. <br>
            At 2σ, this increases to 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within 3σ of the mean ¹. <br>

            The demonstration requires calculating the integral of the pdf over the entire actual range, which guarantees that the total area under the curve is equal to 1 (as it represents the total probability). <br>
            However, this process involves highly advanced integral calculus and mathematical analysis techniques that are intricate and require extensive calculus and probability knowledge. <br>
            For a comprehensive presentation of the normal distribution, it is recommended that one refers to advanced statistical or probability textbooks as a full demonstration would necessitate significant space and detailed mathematical notation. <br>

            Here is a simulation of the Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1: <br>

            <div class="formula-box">
                import numpy as np
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

                mu, sigma = 0, 1 # mean and standard deviation
                s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)

                count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 30, density=True)
                plt.plot(bins, 1/(sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *
                        np.exp( - (bins - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2) ),
                        linewidth=2, color='r')
                plt.show()
            </div>
