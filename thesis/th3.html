        <h1>Th3: The Gaussian Distribution Meaning, Derivations, Simulations</h1>
            <strong>The Gaussian distribution</strong>, also known as the **normal distribution**, is a probability distribution that is widely used for modeling continuous random variables ¹³. <br>
            It is a bell-shaped curve that is dependent on the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ) ¹. The probability density function of the univariate Gaussian distribution is given by: <br><br>
        
            <div class="formula-box">
                <script type="math/tex">
                    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
                </script>
            </div> <br>
        
            where: <br>
            &nbsp    - f(x) is the probability density of obtaining the value xx. <br>
            &nbsp    - μ is the mean of the distribution. <br>
            &nbsp    - σ is the standard deviation of the distribution. <br>
            &nbsp    - π is the value of pi (approximately 3.14159). <br><br>
            The peak of the graph is always located at the mean and the area under the curve is always exactly equal to 1 ¹. 68% of all the values lie within one standard deviation of the mean. <br>
            At 2σ, this increases to 95%, and 99.7% of the values lie within 3σ of the mean ¹. <br>

            Moreover, Gaussian distributions have some unique properties. For instance, any linear combination of a fixed collection of normal deviates is a normal deviate.
        
                <br>
                <br>
            <h3><strong><u>Standard normal distribution</u></strong></h3> 
            The simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution. This is a special case when μ=0 and σ=1, and it is described by this probability density function: <br>
            <script type="math/tex">
                \phi(z) = \frac{e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
            </script>
            <br>
            where z is a continuous random variable that has a mean of 0 and a variance and standard deviation of 1. <br>
            The 
            <script type="math/tex">
                \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} 
            </script> is there to make sure that the area under the PDF is equal to one. <br>
            <br>
            <h3><strong><u>General normal distribution</u></strong></h3> 
            Every normal distribution is a version of the standard normal distribution, whose domain has been stretched by the standard deviation and then translated by the mean value: <br>
            <script type="math/tex">
                f(x| \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{v} \psi\left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)
            </script>
            <br> <br>
            <h3><u>Applications</u></h3> 
            The Gaussian distribution has several utilities and applications, including: <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Modeling Data:</strong> The Gaussian distribution is often used to model and describe real-world data. Many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution pattern. When data is approximately normally distributed, it allows for the use of various statistical techniques.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Statistical Inference:</strong> Many statistical tests rely on the assumption of normality, which simplifies the mathematical procedures and enhances the interpretability of results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Gaussian distributions are used in various machine learning algorithms. For example, Gaussian Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that assumes that features follow a Gaussian distribution. Also, Gaussian Mixture Models are used for clustering and density estimation in unsupervised learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Process Control:</strong> Gaussian distribution is used to monitor and control processes. It helps in identifying deviations and anomalies in production, ensuring products meet quality standards.

                    <li>
                    <strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> In finance, the Gaussian distribution is often used to model asset returns and assess financial risk. The concept of value at risk (VaR) relies on the assumption of normally distributed returns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <strong>Physics and Engineering:</strong> The Gaussian distribution is essential in various areas of physics and engineering, such as thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and the modeling of random processes.
