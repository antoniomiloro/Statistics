        <h1>Th11: The functional CLT (Donsker's invariance principle): Proof, Simulations</h1>
        Donsker's Invariance Principle, also known as the Functional Central Limit Theorem, is a functional extension of the Central Limit Theorem. It was named after Monroe D. Donsker and it extends the convergence of the Central Limit Theorem to the whole function. <br><br>
        <u>Here is a simplified version of the theorem</u>: <br>
        Let's consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. This stochastic process is known as a random walk. <br>
        We can define the diffusively rescaled random walk (partial-sum process) by a certain function. The Central Limit Theorem asserts that this function converges in distribution to a standard Gaussian random variable as the number of variables goes to infinity. <br>
        Donsker's Invariance Principle extends this convergence to the whole function. <br>
        More precisely, in its modern form, Donsker's Invariance Principle states that as random variables taking values in the Skorokhod space, the random function converges in distribution to a standard Brownian motion as the number of variables goes to infinity. <br><br>

        <u>The formula for the functional CLT is as follows</u>: <br>
        Let <script type="math/tex">X_1, X_2</script>, ... be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with mean zero and variance one. <br>
        Define the partial sum process <script type="math/tex">S_n(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor nt \rfloor} X_i</script> for t in [0, 1], where <script type="math/tex">\lfloor \cdot \rfloor</script> denotes the floor function. Then, as <script type="math/tex">n \to \infty</script> , the process <script type="math/tex">S_n(t)</script> converges in distribution to a standard Brownian motion <script type="math/tex">W(t)</script> in the space of continuous functions on [0, 1], denoted by C[0, 1]. <br>
        That is: <br>
        <div class="formula-box">
            \[\frac{S_n(t)}{\sqrt{n}} \xrightarrow{d} W(t) \quad \text{in } C[0, 1].\]
        </div>
        <br>
        <strong><u>Proof</u>:</strong> <br><br>
        As for the proof, it involves a deep understanding of measure theory, probability theory, and functional analysis. <br>
        The original proof by Donsker was not quite correct due to the problem of measurability of the functionals of discontinuous processes. <br>
        However, in 1956, Skorokhod and Kolmogorov defined a separable metric on the space of càdlàg functions on [0,1], such that convergence for this metric to a continuous function is equivalent to convergence for the sup norm, and showed that the function converges in law to the Brownian bridge. <br><br>

        <strong><u>Simulations</u>:</strong> <br><br>
        For simulations, Donsker's Theorem allows us to simulate paths of the one-dimensional standard Brownian motion using different kinds of random walks. <br>
        The exact distributions of the steps of the random walk do not matter when we take the limit as time and step distance shrink to zero. This shows that the Wiener process is a universal scaling limit of a large class of random walks. <br>

        Please note that this is a simplified explanation and the actual proof and simulations involve more complex mathematical concepts and techniques. <br>
        If you're interested in a more detailed explanation, I recommend referring to academic resources or textbooks on probability theory and stochastic processes.
