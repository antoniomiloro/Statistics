        <h1>Th2: The CLT Meaning, Proof, Simulations</h1>
        <h4>
            The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in probability theory that states that if we take sufficiently large samples from a population, the samples’ means will be normally distributed, even if the population isn’t normally distributed ¹²³. <br> 
            This theorem is widely used in statistical inference and hypothesis testing. <br>
            The CLT has several key characteristics: <br>
                - The sample size must be sufficiently large. <br>
                - The samples must be independent and identically distributed. <br>
                - The population distribution can be any distribution. <br>

            The formula for the CLT is as follows: <br>
            ```
            Z = (X̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)
            ```
            where: <br>
                - `Z` is the standard normal variable. <br>
                - `X̄` is the sample mean. <br>
                - `μ` is the population mean. <br>
                - `σ` is the population standard deviation. <br>
                - `n` is the sample size. <br>

            The CLT has been proven mathematically, and its proof is beyond the scope of this response. However, it is important to note that the CLT is a fundamental concept in probability theory and has been widely used in simulations and statistical analysis ¹²³. <br><br>
