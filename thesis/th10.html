        <h1>Th10: The Wiener process and the GBM, Derivations and simulations</h1>
        The <strong>Wiener process</strong>, also known as <strong>Brownian motion</strong>, is a continuous-time stochastic process where the change in the variable is proportional to the square root of the time interval and a random Gaussian variable¹. <br>
        It is often used to model random events that happen over time¹. <br>
        A Wiener process is a real-valued continuous-time stochastic process named in honor of American mathematician Norbert Wiener¹. <br>
        It is often also called Brownian motion due to its historical connection with the physical process of the same name originally observed by Scottish botanist Robert Brown¹. <br><br>

        <strong><u>Properties</u>:</strong> <br><br>
        - The Wiener process is characterized by the following properties¹: <br>
        &nbsp    - W0 = 0 almost surely. <br>
        &nbsp    - W has independent increments: for every t > 0, the future increments Wt+u - Wt, u ≥ 0, are independent of the past values Ws, s < t. <br>
        &nbsp    - W has Gaussian increments: Wt+u - Wt is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance u, Wt+u - Wt ∼ N(0,u). <br><br>

        The Wiener process can be derived from the fundamental solution of the heat equation, which is a partial differential equation that describes the diffusion of heat in a medium. <br>
        The solution is given by the formula: <br>
        <div class="formula-box">
            \[u(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi t}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{4t}}\]
        </div> <br>

        This function represents the probability density of finding a particle at position x at time t, given that it started at the origin at time 0. <br>
        If we let X_t be the random variable that denotes the position of the particle at time t, then we have: <br>
        <div class="formula-box">
            \[X_t \sim N(0, 2t)\]
        </div> <br>

        To obtain the Wiener process, we simply take the difference of two independent normal variables: <br>
        <div class="formula1-box">
            \[W_t = X_t - X_0 \sim N(0, 2t) - N(0, 0) = N(0, 2t)\]
        </div> <br><br>

        <strong><u>Simulations</u>:</strong> <br><br>
        - There are several methods to simulate a Wiener process³. <br>
        This Python code generates a lot of Monte Carlo simulations using the Wiener process with the SP500 data³. <br><br><br>

        The <strong>Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)</strong> is a type of stochastic process where the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a Wiener process with drift⁴. <br>
        It is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Black–Scholes model⁴. <br><br>
        A stochastic process St is said to follow a GBM if it satisfies the following stochastic differential equation (SDE): <script type="math/tex">dS_t = μS_t dt + σS_t dW_t</script>, <br>
        where: <br>
        &nbsp - W_t is a Wiener process or Brownian motion <br>
        &nbsp - μ ('the percentage drift') <br>
        &nbsp - σ ('the percentage volatility') are constants⁴ <br>
        The solution for an arbitrary initial value S0 the above SDE has the analytic solution (under Itô's interpretation): <script type="math/tex">S_t = S_0 exp((μ - σ²/2)t + σW_t)</script>⁴<br><br>

        <strong><u>Properties</u>:</strong> <br><br>
        The GBM has the following properties: <br>

        - <strong>it has a log-normal distribution:</strong> <script type="math/tex">$\log S_t \sim N(\log S_0 + (\mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2) t, \sigma^2 t)$</script> <br>
        - <strong>it has independent returns:</strong> <script type="math/tex">$\frac{S_t - S_s}{S_s}$ is independent of $S_u$ for any $u &lt; s &lt; t$</script> <br>
        - <strong>it has a constant expected return:</strong> <script type="math/tex">$E[\frac{S_t - S_s}{S_s}] = e^{\mu (t-s)} - 1$</script> <br> 
        - <strong>it has a constant variance of returns:</strong> <script type="math/tex">$Var[\frac{S_t - S_s}{S_s}] = (e^{\sigma^2 (t-s)} - 1) e^{2 \mu (t-s)}$</script> <br><br>

        <strong><u>Simulations</u>:</strong> <br><br>
        - There are several methods to simulate a GBM⁵. <br>
        For example, to calculate the value at risk (VaR) of a portfolio, we can run a Monte Carlo simulation that attempts to predict the worst likely loss for a portfolio given a confidence interval over a specified time horizon⁵.
