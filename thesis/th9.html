        <h1>Th9: The Poisson Process: Meaning, Properties, Simulations</h1>
        
        The <strong>Poisson Process</strong> is a type of stochastic process, often used to model random events such as the arrival of customers at a shop or emails to a mail server. <br>
        A Poisson process is a renewal process where the interarrival intervals have an exponential distribution function. <br><br>

        <strong><u>Properties</u>:</strong> <br><br>
        - The number of events in any interval of length t is a Poisson random variable with parameter λt, where λ is the rate of the process. <br>
        This means that the probability of observing k events in an interval of length t is given by: <br>
        <div class="formula-box">
            \[P(N(t) = k) = \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}\]
        </div> <br>
        - The distribution of the number of arrivals between, say, t and t+s depends only on the length of the interval s and not on the starting point t. <br>
        - All inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed and independent with mean 1/λ.  <br>
        This means that the probability that the time between two events is greater than t is given by: <br>
        <div class="formula1-box">
            \[P(X &gt; t) = e^{-\lambda t}\]
        </div> <br>
        - An alternative definition of a Poisson process is of a counting process whose inter-arrival times are distributed exponentially and independently. <br>
        - The Poisson process is unique among renewal processes due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. <br><br>

        <strong><u>Simulations</u>:</strong> <br><br>
        There are several methods to simulate a Poisson process, including direct methods based on the homogeneous Poisson stochastic process having exponential inter-arrival times, inversion methods that search through a table of cumulative Poisson probabilities, <br>
        methods that use the recursive properties of the Poisson distribution, and acceptance-rejection methods. <br>
        Simulating a Poisson point process on a computer is usually done in a bounded region of space, known as a simulation window, and requires two steps: appropriately creating a random number of points and then suitably placing the points in a random manner. <br>
        There are also demonstrations available that show simulated paths of the Poisson process. <br><br>
        <u>Examples</u>: <br><br>

        - Simulating the number of customers arriving at a store in a given hour. <br>
        We can assume that the arrival rate is λ = 10 customers per hour, and generate random numbers from a Poisson distribution with mean λt, where t is the length of the interval in hours. <br>
        For example, if we want to simulate the number of customers in the first 15 minutes, we can use t = 0.25 and generate a random number from a Poisson distribution with mean 10 × 0.25 = 2.5. <br>
        This can be done using the rpois function in R, as shown below: <br>
        <div class="formula-box">
            # Set the seed for reproducibility <br>
            set.seed(123) <br><br>

            # Simulate the number of customers in the first 15 minutes <br>
            rpois(1, lambda = 10 * 0.25)<br>
            #> [1] 1
        </div> <br>

        - Simulating the time of the first earthquake in a region. <br>
        We can assume that the earthquakes follow a Poisson process with rate λ = 0.01 earthquakes per day, and generate random numbers from an exponential distribution with mean 1/λ. <br>
        For example, if we want to simulate the time of the first earthquake, we can generate a random number from an exponential distribution with mean 1/0.01 = 100 days. <br>
        This can be done using the rexp function in R, as shown below: <br>
        <div class="formula-box">
            # Set the seed for reproducibility <br>
            set.seed(123) <br><br>

            # Simulate the time of the first earthquake <br>
            rexp(1, rate = 0.01) <br>
            #> [1] 52.2019
        </div> <br><br>
