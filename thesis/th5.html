        <h1>Th5: Statistical Distributions: Continuous, Discrete, Properties and simulations</h1>
        <h4>
            Statistical distributions are mathematical functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes from a random process. They are divided into two main types: discrete and continuous distributions²⁴⁵. <br><br>
            - <strong>Discrete distributions:</strong> <br>
            Discrete distributions are used when the outcomes are countable, like the number of heads when flipping a coin. It is a variable that has a value with finite (integer) interval and has a finite limit. <br>
            Examples include the binomial and Poisson distributions². <br>
            &nbsp - <strong>Binomial Distribution</strong>: Suppose you flip a coin 10 times. The number of times it lands on heads follows a binomial distribution. Each flip is an independent event, and the probability of success (landing on heads) is the same for each flip¹. <br>
            &nbsp - <strong>Poisson Distribution</strong>>: If you're counting the number of emails you receive in a day, this could follow a Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution models the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time or space³. <br><br>

            - <strong>Continuous distributions:</strong> <br>
            Continuous distributions, on the other hand, are used when the outcomes can take on any value within a certain range, like the measurement of height or weight. These outcomes can have infinite decimal places. <br>
            Examples include the normal and exponential distributions⁴⁵. <br>
            &nbsp - <strong>Normal Distribution</strong>: Human heights follow a normal distribution. Most people are of average height, while fewer people are very short or very tall¹. <br>
            &nbsp - <strong>Exponential Distribution</strong>: If you're waiting for a bus and the time between buses is exponentially distributed, then the time you have to wait for the next bus follows an exponential distribution⁴. <br><br>

            Each distribution has its own properties, such as the mean (average), variance (spread), skewness (asymmetry), and kurtosis (tailedness). <br>
            These properties help describe the shape and characteristics of the distribution¹. <br><br>
            - <strong>Simulations:</strong> <br>
            Simulations often use these distributions to generate random variables that mimic real-world randomness. For instance, a simulation of a call center might use a Poisson distribution to model the number of incoming calls per hour³. <br>
            Remember, the choice of distribution depends on the nature of the process and the type of data you are dealing with². <br>
