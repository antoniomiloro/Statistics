        <h3>1. What is Statistics and its relationship with other disciplines. 
            Difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.
        </h3>
        <h5>Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data ¹. 
            It is an interdisciplinary field that has applications in various domains such as science, engineering, medicine, economics, and social sciences ¹. 
            <br>
            Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics are two main branches of statistics. Descriptive statistics aims to describe a chunk of raw data using summary statistics, graphs, and tables ¹. 
            It is useful because it allows you to understand a group of data much more quickly and easily compared to just staring at rows and rows of raw data values ¹. 
            For example, suppose we have a set of raw data that shows the test scores of 1,000 students at a particular school. We might be interested in the average test score along with the distribution of test scores. 
            Using descriptive statistics, we could find the average score and create a graph that helps us visualize the distribution of scores. This allows us to understand the test scores of the students much more easily compared to just staring at the raw data ¹.
            
            Inferential statistics, on the other hand, makes inferences about a larger population based on sample data ². 
            It is useful when you want to make predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample ². For example, suppose we want to know the average height of all people in Italy. 
            It would be impractical to measure the height of every single person in Italy. Instead, we could take a sample of people from Italy and use inferential statistics to make an estimate about the average height of all people in Italy ².

        <h3>2. Describe the concepts of Population, Sample Attribute, Variable, Level of measurement and Dataset.</h3>
        <h5>
            - <u>Population</u>: a population is a group of individuals, objects, or events that share a common characteristic ². In statistics, it refers to the entire group of interest that we want to study ³. For example, if we want to study the average height of all people in Italy, then the population would be all people in Italy.
            <br>
            - <u>Sample</u>: a sample is a subset of a population ³. It is a smaller group that is selected from the population and used to represent the population ³. For example, if we want to study the average height of all people in Italy, it would be impractical to measure the height of every single person in Italy. Instead, we could take a sample of people from Italy and use inferential statistics to make an estimate about the average height of all people in Italy ².
            <br>
            - <u>Attribute</u>: an attribute is a characteristic or feature of an individual or object ². In statistics, it refers to any variable that can be measured or observed ². For example, if we are studying the average height of all people in Italy, then height would be an attribute.
            <br>
            - <u>Variable</u>: a variable is any characteristic or feature that can take on different values across your data set ¹. In other words, it is anything that can vary or change ¹. For example, if we are studying the average height of all people in Italy, then height would be a variable.
            <br>
            - <u>Level of measurement</u>: the level of measurement refers to how precisely variables are recorded ¹. There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio ¹. Nominal data can only be categorized; ordinal data can be categorized and ranked; interval data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced; ratio data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero point ¹.
            <br>
            - <u>Dataset</u>: a dataset is a collection of data that has been organized into some kind of structure ². It can be used for analysis and interpretation using statistical methods.

        <h3>3. Briefly describe the main sampling methods.</h3>
        <h5>
            There are two primary types of sampling methods: probability sampling and non-probability sampling ¹. <br>
            Probability sampling involves random selection, allowing you to make strong statistical inferences about the whole group ¹. There are several types of probability sampling methods:
            <br>
            &nbsp 1. Simple random sampling: in a simple random sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected ¹. <br>
            &nbsp 2. Systematic sampling: systematic sampling is similar to simple random sampling, but it is usually slightly easier to conduct ¹. <br>
            &nbsp 3. Stratified sampling: stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups based on some characteristic and then selecting a sample from each subgroup ¹. <br>
            &nbsp 4. Cluster sampling: cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters and then randomly selecting some of those clusters to be included in the sample ¹. <br>
            <br>
            Non-probability sampling involves non-random selection based on convenience or other criteria, allowing you to easily collect data ¹. There are several types of non-probability sampling methods:
            <br>
            &nbsp 1. Convenience sampling: convenience sampling involves selecting individuals who are easily accessible or convenient to study ¹. <br>
            &nbsp 2. Judgmental (or purposive) sampling: judgmental (or purposive) sampling involves selecting individuals based on your judgment or knowledge of the population ¹. <br>
            &nbsp 3. Snowball sampling: snowball sampling involves selecting individuals based on referrals from other participants ¹. <br>
            &nbsp 4. Quota sampling: quota sampling involves selecting individuals based on pre-specified quotas for certain characteristics such as age, gender, or ethnicity ¹.

        <h3>4. Briefly describe the main experiment designs.</h3>
        <h5>
            Experimental design is the process of planning and executing experiments to test hypotheses or answer research questions ¹. There are several types of experimental designs, including:
            <br>
            &nbsp - Pre-experimental designs: these designs are used when it is not possible to use a true experimental design. They include one-shot case study, one-group pretest-posttest design, and static-group comparison ². <br>
            &nbsp - True experimental designs: these designs involve randomly assigning participants to groups and manipulating the independent variable. They include pretest-posttest control group design, posttest-only control group design, and Solomon four-group design ². <br>
            &nbsp - Quasi-experimental designs: these designs are used when it is not possible to use a true experimental design due to ethical or practical reasons. They include nonequivalent control group design, time-series design, and interrupted time-series design ². <br>
            &nbsp - Factorial designs: these designs involve manipulating two or more independent variables to study their effects on the dependent variable. They include main effects and interaction effects ³. <br>
            &nbsp - Single-subject designs: these designs are used when studying a single individual or group over time. They include A-B-A-B reversal design, multiple-baseline design, and changing-criterion design ⁴.
